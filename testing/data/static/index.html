<section class="install" id="sparc-install">
<h2>Quick Install</h2>
<p>If you like to live dangerously you can use the command
below to install the latest nightly build on your Linux
system:</p>
<code class="code-shell">curl -sSL https://sparc.sh | sh</code>
<p>The prefered way is to download the builds from the ftp
server at ftp.sparc.sh and to verify checksums like so:</p>
<code class="code-shell">curl -sO https://ftp.sparc.sh/latest.sha256
curl -sS https://ftp.sparc.sh/latest.tar.gz | tar xz
sha256sum -c latest.sha256</code>
<h2>Build from Source</h2>
<p>You can get the latest sources from the git repository
at git.sparc.sh. There is a telnet manpage server if you
don't want to install the docs locally. See the next two
sections on how to proceed with the build.</p>
<code class="code-shell">git clone git@git.sparc.sh
telnet man.sparc.sh</code>
<h3>Linux Build</h3>
<p>On your first build you need to run the configure script
to detect your toolchain. You can pass the --prefix=path
argument to change the installation path. Depending on
your selected prefix you might need sudo to install.</p>
<code class="code-shell">cd sparc
./configure --prefix=/usr
make &amp;&amp; make install</code>
<h3>Windows Build</h3>

<section class="about" id="sparc-about">
<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>SPARC is an unified emulation architecture. It handles
platform abstraction, memory management and provides a
clean framework for common chips (CPUs, VPDs, PSGs). It
is the backend for GAS and streamlines the process of
creating emulators for different operating systems.</p>
<p>GAS runs on top of SPARC and implements the cores for
each gaming console. Emulation should be as accurate as
possible while keeping the software simple to use. Most
things should just work (TM) out of the box as long as
the user provides their ROM backups for BIOS and games.
GAS implements the FIREBEE file format see doc/FIREBEE.</p>
<p>An important consideration is portability. Both in the
binary sense and in regards to how easy it is for the
user to migrate their files between multiple systems.
Savegames and config can be stored on a user provided
FTP server to keep multiple device states synchronized.
Savegames are packaged as a single file for each user
but can be exported back to a format that can be copied
to original storage devices like memory cards.</p>
<p>There will be no savestates or other capabilities that
were not present on the original hardware. I am trying
to stay as true to the real thing as I can.</p>
<p>SPARC runs on Windows and Linux either natively or with
SDL2. Maybe Android and Xbox can be supported later.
Porting should be fairly straightforward.</p>
</section>

<section class="settings" id="sparc-settings">
<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>There are three ways in which you can change how the
emulator runs: command-line, config files and the RC
startup script. (Well and a graphical menu later but
that is just an extension of the config file.)</p>

<h3>Command-line</h3>
<p>GAS has a simple command-line interface which can also
be used to do some game library housekeeping. See
doc/SCRIPTING for more info.</p>
<code class="code-shell">gas [options] [rom-file ..]

-s, --set &lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt;
    Sets variable to specified value. Has priority
    over any values set in the config file.

-a, --arch &lt;architecture&gt;
    Sets emulation architecture.

-b, --boot &lt;bios-file&gt;
    Boots given BIOS file.

-o, --open &lt;rom-file&gt;
    Loads given ROM file. Can be omitted by listing
    the files after any command-line options. If
    none are given the user library is shown.

-v, --version
    Prints installed version.
</code>

<h3>Config File</h3>
<p>The global settings file is /etc/gas.cfg. By default the
user overwrites can be found in $HOME/.gas/user.cfg. If
you would rather keep files seperate from user homes you
can set rootdir in the global config like so:</p>
<code class="code-shell">rootdir = /tmp/gas/</code>
<p>Comments start with the hash symbol. Strings don't have
to be quoted unless you're using the hash symbol as part
of the value. Values start after the equals symbol until
simply either the end of line or the start of a comment.
Strings are considered everything that is not a number
and not a boolean value.</p>
<code class="code-shell">portable     = true      # See "File Paths" section
loglevel     = debug     # debug, info, warning, error
biosdir      = /bios/    # BIOS dir relative to rootdir
romdir       = /roms/    # ROM dir relative to rootdir
xinput       = true      # Handle controller input
fullscreen   = false     # Small debug window
width        = 640
height       = 480
</code>
<p>The settings in /etc/gas.conf are overwritten by local
user settings. They provide default config values in
case the user has not set those values in their local
file (or the file do not exist and the program does not
have permissions to create it).</p>

<h3>Startup RC Script</h3>
<p>Startup scripts are most useful for debug purposes and
also nice for creating small housekeeping scripts. By
default the script .gasrc in the user directory is run
when starting GAS:</p>
<code class="code-shell">arch gg
boot gg-bios.gg
open gg-shinobi.gg
arch gb
boot gb-bios.sms
open gb-aladdin.sms

<section class="paths" id="sparc-paths">
<h2>File Paths</h2>
<p>Note that all the paths can be changed from the global
config file. If there is no gas.cfg in the same folder
as the executable then the path is /etc/gas.cfg.</p>
<code class="code-shell">/etc/gas.cfg      # Global settings
/usr/gas/rom      # Shared ROM files
$HOME/.gas/
    /gasrc        # Local RC file
    /user.cfg     # Local settings
    /saves.bee    # Save games
    /bios/        # BIOS files
    /roms/        # ROM files
</code>
<h3>Portable setup</h3>
<p>If you enable the setting to package user data you only
need to move around 3-4 files. Use the following command
to create a portable install in /tmp/gas:</p>
<code class="code-shell">export DIR=/tmp/gas
install -d 0755 $DIR
install -m 0755 /usr/bin/gas $DIR
cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; $DIR/gas.cfg
    portable = true
    packuser = true
    userfile = gas.bee
    rootdir  = .
EOF
</code>
<p>Run GAS once from the new directory and it should have
created the structure below. Add your user settings to
gas.cfg and you could move this folder to an USB drive.</p>
<code class="code-shell">/tmp/gas
    /gas.cfg    # Settings file as created above.
    /gas.bee    # User bios, roms and save games.
    /gasrc      # Startup script, can be deleted.
    /gas        # Binaries for different systems.

<h2>Name Ideas</h2>
<p>Other name ideas ranging from neat to kafkaesque:</p>
<code class="code-markdown">
- BEE     Better Emulation Engine. Could be a sweet
          file extension? 3 letters and can be written
          in hexadecimal as file signature 0xBEE. It
          can then be followed by the type nibble 0-F.
          A valid range of file sub types would then
          be(e) from 0xBEE0 until 0xBEEF. Where do
          bees live? Hexagons. Pretty magical, no?

- FIRE    Fully Integrated Retro Emulation
- GEAR    Game Emulation Architecture

- PIMPLE  Platform Independent Media Preservation and
          Legacy Emulation (Now we're talking...)

- MENIMEM My Extremly Naive Implementation of Emulators
